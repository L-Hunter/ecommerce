# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 10.times do
# 	fname = Faker::Name.first_name
# 	lname = Faker::Name.last_name
# 	email = Faker::Internet.email
# 	ccnum = Faker::Business.credit_card_number
# 	cctype = Faker::Business.credit_card_type
# 	street = Faker::Address.street_address
# 	city = Faker::Address.city


# 	User.create(fname: fname, lname: lname, street: street, city: city, email: email, password: "password1", ccnum: ccnum, cctype: cctype)

# end

# 20.times do
# 	pname = Faker::Commerce.product_name
# 	price = Faker::Commerce.price
# 	image = Faker::LoremPixel.image

# 	Product.create(pname: pname, price: price, image: image)
